Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
It is systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems while traditional programming involves writing code to create software programs.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
It is a structured process that guides the development of software applications from conception to deployment and maintenance. Involves the following phases: 
1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. requirements: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. design: creating high level and detailed design of software architecture and user interface.
3. implementation: writing code and building the software according to design specifications.
4. testing: conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. deployment: releasing the software to users or customers.
6. maintenance: providing ongoing support, updates and enhnacements to the software after deploying.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile models is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. It is used in long term projects
Waterfall model is sequential approach with distinct phases following downwards like waterfall. A good scenarios for this short term projects

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the process of gahering and documenting user needs and system requirements. it involves:
1. Gathering of requirements. This can be done through interviews, questionnaires or workshops
2. Analysis of requirements. This helps identify conflicts, ambiguities and inconsistencies.
3. Requirement specifications. Involves documenting requiremets in a clear manner.
4. Requirement validation. Ensures the documented requirements accurately reflect user needs and are feasible to implement.
5. Requirement management. Helps handle changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle ensuring traceability and consistency.
requirement engineering is important in that it gives clear user needs that will be used to implement a system.


Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity refers to practice of dividing a software system into distinct, manageable and interchangeable components knowns as modules.
It helps improve maintainability by providing easier debugging and testing of different modules. 
Different modules can be scaled incrementally by adding more instances of speciffic modules.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing: involves testing individual components or modules of a software
Integration testing: involves testing interactions between different components or subsystem.
System testing: involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing: involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Testing is crucial in software development because it is a critical aspect of quality assurance of the software.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Example is Git. Unique feature of git is it is a distributed system which stores local repositories.

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
The role of a project manager is to oversee the planning, execution and delivery of sotware projects.
The challenges faced in managing software projects are: 
1. changing requirements
2. tight deadlines.
3. technical debt
4. strategies for overcoming challenges.

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is providing on going support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.
Different types of maintenance activities include:
1. corrective maintenance
2. adaptive maintenance
3. perfective maintenance
4. preventive maintenance
maintenance is essential in that it helps contribute to longevity, reliability and adaptability of software systems.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues software engineers might face are:
1. privacy and data protection
2. security
3. intellectual property
4. software reliablity and safety
5. legal compliance
Software engineers can ensure they adhere to ethical standards by:
1. follow professional codes of conduct
2. implement best practices in development
3. engage in ethical decision making
4. promote transparency and accountability
5. ensure privacy and data protection
